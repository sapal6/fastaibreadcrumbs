## How to use

Just import "fastaibreadcrumbs" and get started.

Some tiny convience functions are available which are handy while working on projects based on [fastkaggle](https://fastai.github.io/fastkaggle/) and/or [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/). 

A couple of examples are `setup_data` to setup kaggle data on your local machine and `crappifier` to create crappified version of image data. Explore the "fastaibreadcrumbs.core" page for more functions.
